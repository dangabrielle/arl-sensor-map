6/20-21: Currently working on app ideas for a fullstack Nextjs application (need to discuss with Baseem). Reviewing React and learning Next.js -- working on a sample dashboard app tutorial https://github.com/dangabrielle/dashboard-app-nextjs. Update: decided to start setting up the backend (express server with Node, and postgresQL integration), intially attempted to install openTAK server but it does not have documentation for macOS.

6/26-28 Worked on soldering basics and miso assembly. Set up nextjs frontend and backend with postgres + prisma (ORM), successfully sent a POST request from the client (browser) to the server containing mock JSON data, and updating the UI. Looking into mqtt and websocket protocols and how I will incorporate that into my project. Hope to send in figma mockup on Monday.
